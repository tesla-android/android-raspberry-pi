## Licenseing

## Warning!

## Flashing images

Find the sdcard image or archive with fastboot images [here](https://github.com/tesla-android/android-raspberry-pi/releases)

Use the SDCard raw image to flash the Android into SDCard.

Or use the fastboot images archive to download Android on SDCard using fastboot mode:  

### Step 1
Extract the content of the archive.  
Using any available iso-to-usb utility, prepare recovery SDCARD.  
To flash Android on a sdcard, use *deploy-sd.img*  
  
### Step 2
Ensure you have installed the adb package: ```$ sudo apt install adb``` (required to set up udev rules)  
Insert recovery sdcard into the phone.  
Connect the phone and your PC using a typec cable.  
Power up the phone. Blue LED indicates that the phone is in bootloader mode, and you can proceed with flashing.  
  
### Step 3
Run .*/flash-sd.sh* utility for flashing Android to sdcard  
  
*After several minutes flashing should complete, and Android should boot*  

## Building from sources

Before building, ensure your system has at least 32GB of RAM, a swap file is at least 8GB, and 300GB of free disk space available.

### Install system packages
(Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is only supported. Building on other distributions can be done using docker)
<br/>

- [Install AOSP required packages](https://source.android.com/setup/build/initializing).
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y git-core gnupg flex bison build-essential zip curl zlib1g-dev gcc-multilib g++-multilib libc6-dev-i386 lib32ncurses5-dev x11proto-core-dev libx11-dev lib32z1-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libxml2-utils xsltproc unzip fontconfig
```

<br/>

- Install additional packages
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y swig libssl-dev flex bison device-tree-compiler mtools git gettext libncurses5 libgmp-dev libmpc-dev cpio rsync dosfstools kmod gdisk lz4 meson cmake libglib2.0-dev git-lfs
```

<br/>

- Install additional packages (for building mesa3d, libcamera, and other meson-based components)
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip pkg-config python3-dev ninja-build
sudo pip3 install mako jinja2 ply pyyaml pyelftools
```

- Install the `repo` tool
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y python-is-python3 wget
wget -P ~/bin http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo
chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
```

### Fetching the sources and building the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tesla-android/android-raspberry-pi.git
cd android-raspberry-pi
```

### Building Tesla Android

```bash
./unfold_aosp.sh && ./build.sh
```

### Running `unfold_aosp.sh` script

To run the `unfold_aosp.sh` script, follow these steps:

* Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed as mentioned in the `README.md` file.
* Navigate to the root directory of the repository.
* Run the `unfold_aosp.sh` script to initialize and sync the AOSP tree. This script is located in the root directory of the repository.

The `unfold_aosp.sh` script will handle the rest of the setup process for the AOSP tree.

### Running `build_cm4.sh` script

To run the `build_cm4.sh` script, follow these steps:

* Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed as mentioned in the `README.md` file.
* Navigate to the root directory of the repository.
* Run the `unfold_aosp.sh` script to initialize and sync the AOSP tree. This script is located in the root directory of the repository.
* Once the AOSP tree is set up, execute the `build_cm4.sh` script by running the following command:
  ```bash
  ./build_cm4.sh
  ```

The `build_cm4.sh` script will handle the rest of the build process for the CM4 target.

### Notes

- Depending on your hardware and internet connection, downloading and building may take 8h or more.  
- After the successful build, find the fastboot images at `./out/images.tar.gz` or sdcard image at `./out/sdcard.img`.
